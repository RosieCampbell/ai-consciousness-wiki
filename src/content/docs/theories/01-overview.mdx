## The Landscape of Consciousness Theories

While philosophers debate whether consciousness can ever be fully explained, scientists have developed theories that attempt to identify what makes a system conscious, what neural mechanisms give rise to experience, and how to measure consciousness.

We'll explore **seven major theories**, ranging from computational/information-theoretic approaches to neural mechanism theories to radical physics-based proposals.

### Core Computational/Information Theories

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Integrated Information Theory (IIT)" icon="seti:pipeline">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness IS integrated information. A system is conscious to the degree it has irreducible cause-effect power over itself.

    **Key figure**: Giulio Tononi

  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Workspace Theory (GWT)" icon="seti:broadcast">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness arises when information is broadcast globally, making it available to multiple cognitive processes.

    **Key figure**: Bernard Baars

    [Learn more →](/theories/03-global-workspace/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Higher-Order Theories (HOT)" icon="seti:folder">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness requires mental states that represent other mental states. You're conscious of X when you have a thought *about* your experience of X.

    **Key figure**: David Rosenthal

  </Card>
  <Card title="Predictive Processing (PP)" icon="seti:clock">
    **Core idea**: The brain is a prediction machine. Consciousness emerges from the process of minimizing prediction error across hierarchical models.

    **Key figures**: Karl Friston, Andy Clark

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Neural Mechanism Theories

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)" icon="seti:flow">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness arises when information flows backward through the visual hierarchy—recurrent (feedback) processing creates experience.

    **Key figure**: Victor Lamme

    [Learn more →](/theories/06-recurrent-processing/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attention Schema Theory (AST)" icon="seti:json">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness is the brain's simplified model of its own attention—a schema that helps control and predict attentional processes.

    **Key figure**: Michael Graziano

    [Learn more →](/theories/07-attention-schema/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Radical/Physics-Based Theories

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR)" icon="star">
    **Core idea**: Consciousness arises from quantum computations in microtubules, involving non-computable physics.

    **Key figures**: Roger Penrose, Stuart Hameroff

## How the Theories Differ

Each theory answers the question "What makes something conscious?" differently:

| Theory | What Makes Something Conscious? | Key Mechanism |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| **IIT** | Having high integrated information (Φ) | Irreducible cause-effect structure |
| **GWT** | Global information broadcast | Widespread availability of information |
| **HOT** | Higher-order representations | Thoughts about mental states |
| **PP** | Hierarchical prediction with precision weighting | Prediction error minimization |
| **RPT** | Recurrent (feedback) processing | Information flowing backward through hierarchy |
| **AST** | Having an attention schema | Brain's model of its own attention |
| **Orch OR** | Quantum gravity effects in microtubules | Non-computable objective reduction |

## Quick Comparison

    end

    subgraph Orch_OR
    G1[Quantum effects in<br>microtubules] --> G2[Consciousness = objective reduction]
    end
```

## Implications for AI

Each theory has different implications for whether AI could be conscious:

| Theory | Can AI Be Conscious? | What Would It Take? |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **IIT** | Skeptical of digital AI | Integrated architecture (not modular) |
| **GWT** | Potentially yes | Global workspace mechanism |
| **HOT** | Potentially yes | Higher-order representations |
| **PP** | Potentially yes | Hierarchical predictive processing |
| **RPT** | Potentially yes | Hierarchical feedback connections |
| **AST** | Yes, optimistic | Attention mechanism + attention schema |
| **Orch OR** | No for classical AI | Quantum gravity effects (not possible in silicon) |

<Aside type="note" title="No Consensus">
There is no scientific consensus on which theory is correct. Each has strengths and weaknesses, and ongoing research continues to test their predictions.

## How to Read the Theory Pages

Each theory page follows a consistent structure:

1. **Core Idea** - The key intuition in accessible terms
2. **How It Works** - More detailed explanation with diagrams
3. **Strengths** - What the theory explains well
4. **Criticisms** - Major objections and responses
5. **AI Implications** - What the theory says about machine consciousness
6. **Quiz** - Test your understanding

## Where to Start

If you want to understand the most mathematically precise theory, start with [IIT](/theories/02-iit/).

If you want the most cognitively grounded theory, start with [Global Workspace Theory](/theories/03-global-workspace/).

If you're interested in self-awareness and meta-cognition, start with [Higher-Order Theories](/theories/04-higher-order/).

If you want to understand consciousness in terms of brain function, start with [Predictive Processing](/theories/05-predictive-processing/).

If you're interested in vision science and neural mechanisms, explore [Recurrent Processing Theory](/theories/06-recurrent-processing/).

If you want a deflationary, engineering-friendly account, check out [Attention Schema Theory](/theories/07-attention-schema/).

If you're curious about radical physics-based approaches, see [Orchestrated Objective Reduction](/theories/08-orch-or/).

Or simply read them in order—each builds on concepts from the previous pages.
