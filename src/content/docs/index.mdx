## Featured Theories

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Integrated Information Theory" icon="seti:pipeline">
    Consciousness is integrated information. A system is conscious to the degree it generates information beyond its parts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Workspace Theory" icon="seti:broadcast">
    Consciousness arises when information is broadcast across a global workspace, making it available to multiple cognitive processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Higher-Order Theories" icon="seti:folder">
    Being conscious requires having thoughts about your own mental states. Meta-cognition is key.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Predictive Processing" icon="seti:clock">
    The brain is a prediction machine. Consciousness emerges from minimizing prediction error about the world and self.
