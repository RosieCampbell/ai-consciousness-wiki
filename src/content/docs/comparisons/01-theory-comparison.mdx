| **Substrate independence** | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Current AI** | No | Unlikely | Uncertain | Unlikely | Unlikely | Uncertain | No |
| **Future AI** | Needs new hardware | Possible | Possible | Possible | Possible | Possible | No (digital) |

| **Testable?** | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Limited |

## Where They Agree

Despite their differences, the theories share some common ground:

1. **Consciousness is real** - All reject eliminativism (the view that consciousness doesn't exist)
2. **It's a natural phenomenon** - All seek scientific explanations, not supernatural ones
3. **Integration matters** - All emphasize some form of information integration or coordination
4. **Self-relation** - All involve the system relating to itself in some way
5. **Not just behavior** - All distinguish consciousness from mere behavioral capacity

## Where They Disagree

Key points of divergence:

| Disagreement | Theory Positions |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Substrate** | IIT and Orch OR are restrictive; others are functionally defined |
| **Functionalism** | IIT and Orch OR reject pure functionalism; others embrace it |
| **Panpsychism** | IIT implies limited panpsychism; Orch OR suggests microtubule-based proto-consciousness |
| **AI optimism** | IIT and Orch OR are skeptical; GWT, HOT, PP, RPT, AST are permissive |
| **Qualia** | AST is deflationary (qualia are a construct); IIT claims to explain them; others acknowledge the hard problem |
| **Neural focus** | RPT focuses on sensory processing; GWT/HOT on frontal involvement; PP on hierarchical prediction |

<Aside type="note" title="No Consensus">
[There is no scientific consensus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-022-00587-4) on which theory is correct. Each has empirical support and unresolved challenges. The comparison helps understand the landscape, not declare a winner.

  questions={[
    {
      question: "IIT and GWT disagree most fundamentally about:",
      options: [
        "Whether consciousness exists",
        "Whether substrate matters—IIT says causal structure is key, GWT says only function matters",
        "Whether the brain is involved in consciousness",
        "Whether consciousness is graded"
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "IIT claims the actual causal structure matters—simulating a high-Φ system on different hardware doesn't produce consciousness. GWT is functionally defined: implement the right global broadcast function on any substrate, and consciousness follows. This is a deep disagreement about whether substrate-independence holds."

      question: "AST and illusionism differ from IIT in their approach to qualia because:",
      options: [
        "AST and illusionism say qualia are real but IIT denies them",
        "IIT claims qualia are identical to information structure; AST/illusionism say qualia are constructs or illusions",
        "IIT is deflationary while AST is not",
        "They agree on qualia but disagree on other matters"
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "IIT takes qualia seriously as real features of consciousness, identified with cause-effect structure. AST (and illusionism generally) takes a deflationary view: what we call qualia is the brain's constructed model of its processing, not a separate property requiring explanation. They have opposite attitudes toward the 'mysteriousness' of phenomenal experience."
    },
    {
      question: "On which point do ALL major theories agree, despite their differences?",
      options: [
        "That AI can be conscious with the right architecture",
        "That consciousness is real and involves some form of integration or self-relation",
        "That the hard problem is solved",
        "That consciousness requires biological substrate"
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "All theories reject eliminativism (denying consciousness exists). All emphasize some form of integration or self-relation: IIT (integrated information), GWT (global coordination), HOT (self-representation), PP (self-model), RPT (recurrent integration), AST (attention self-model).

    {
      question: "According to the comparison, which theory pair offers the MOST permissive path to AI consciousness?",

        "RPT and IIT—both require specific neural mechanisms",
        "Orch OR and AST—both emphasize quantum effects"
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "GWT and HOT are both functionalist: implement the right functions (global broadcast for GWT; higher-order representation for HOT), and consciousness follows regardless of substrate. This makes them permissive about AI. IIT and Orch OR are more restrictive, requiring specific causal structure or physics that digital computers may lack."
